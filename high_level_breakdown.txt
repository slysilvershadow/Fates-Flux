Step 1: Initial Setup and Libraries
Game Engine: Use a game development library like pygame for 2D graphics and game mechanics.
Procedural Generation: Implement algorithms for generating random worlds and characters.
Artificial Intelligence: Create AI behaviors for NPCs and enemies.
Ecosystem Simulation: Develop a background system to simulate an evolving ecosystem.
Genetics System: Design a system to replicate real-life genetics for characters.
Step 2: Project Structure
We'll organize the project into modules for clarity and maintainability:
Main Game Loop: Handle the primary game loop and state management.
Procedural Generation: Generate worlds, characters, and wildlife.
AI: Implement behaviors for NPCs and enemies.
Ecosystem: Simulate a living and evolving ecosystem.
Genetics: Manage the genetics system and character evolution.
User Interface: Create menus, HUD, and other UI components.
Step 3: Code Implementation
We'll start by setting up the basic game loop using pygame and then build out the various modules incrementally.
Step 4: Procedural Generation
Step 5: AI and Ecosystem Simulation Implement simple AI behaviors and ecosystem rules to make the game world feel alive.
Step 6: Genetics System
Step 7: User Interface and Interaction
Design the UI components and implement user interactions.

Next Steps
Expand AI and Ecosystem: Develop more complex behaviors and ecosystem interactions.
Enhance Procedural Generation: Add variety and depth to the world generation.
Develop Gameplay Mechanics: Implement core gameplay features like diplomacy, combat, and resource management.
Optimize Performance: Ensure the game runs smoothly on mobile devices.
User Testing and Feedback: Gather feedback from users and iterate on the design.
This is a starting point, and the development will involve iterative improvements and expansions to cover all the game features and mechanics.
